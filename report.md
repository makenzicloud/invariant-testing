# Low Issues

## L-1: Unsafe ERC20 Operations should not be used

ERC20 functions may not behave as expected. For example: return values are not always meaningful. It is recommended to use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library.

- Found in src/WETH9.sol [Line: 33](src/WETH9.sol#L33)

	```solidity
	        payable(msg.sender).transfer(wad);
	```



## L-2: Solidity pragma should be specific, not wide

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

- Found in src/WETH9.sol [Line: 2](src/WETH9.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.13;
	```



## L-3: Missing checks for `address(0)` when assigning values to address state variables

Check for `address(0)` when assigning values to address state variables.

- Found in src/WETH9.sol [Line: 32](src/WETH9.sol#L32)

	```solidity
	        balanceOf[msg.sender] -= wad;
	```

- Found in src/WETH9.sol [Line: 42](src/WETH9.sol#L42)

	```solidity
	        allowance[msg.sender][guy] = wad;
	```

- Found in src/WETH9.sol [Line: 56](src/WETH9.sol#L56)

	```solidity
	            allowance[src][msg.sender] -= wad;
	```

- Found in src/WETH9.sol [Line: 59](src/WETH9.sol#L59)

	```solidity
	        balanceOf[src] -= wad;
	```

- Found in src/WETH9.sol [Line: 60](src/WETH9.sol#L60)

	```solidity
	        balanceOf[dst] += wad;
	```



## L-4: `public` functions not used internally could be marked `external`

Instead of marking a function as `public`, consider marking it as `external` if it is not used internally.

- Found in src/WETH9.sol [Line: 30](src/WETH9.sol#L30)

	```solidity
	    function withdraw(uint256 wad) public {
	```

- Found in src/WETH9.sol [Line: 37](src/WETH9.sol#L37)

	```solidity
	    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256) {
	```

- Found in src/WETH9.sol [Line: 41](src/WETH9.sol#L41)

	```solidity
	    function approve(address guy, uint256 wad) public returns (bool) {
	```

- Found in src/WETH9.sol [Line: 47](src/WETH9.sol#L47)

	```solidity
	    function transfer(address dst, uint256 wad) public returns (bool) {
	```



## L-5: Event is missing `indexed` fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

- Found in src/WETH9.sol [Line: 9](src/WETH9.sol#L9)

	```solidity
	    event Approval(address indexed src, address indexed guy, uint256 wad);
	```

- Found in src/WETH9.sol [Line: 10](src/WETH9.sol#L10)

	```solidity
	    event Transfer(address indexed src, address indexed dst, uint256 wad);
	```

- Found in src/WETH9.sol [Line: 11](src/WETH9.sol#L11)

	```solidity
	    event Deposit(address indexed dst, uint256 wad);
	```

- Found in src/WETH9.sol [Line: 12](src/WETH9.sol#L12)

	```solidity
	    event Withdrawal(address indexed src, uint256 wad);
	```



## L-6: Empty `require()` / `revert()` statements

Use descriptive reason strings or custom errors for revert paths.

- Found in src/WETH9.sol [Line: 31](src/WETH9.sol#L31)

	```solidity
	        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= wad);
	```

- Found in src/WETH9.sol [Line: 52](src/WETH9.sol#L52)

	```solidity
	        require(balanceOf[src] >= wad);
	```

- Found in src/WETH9.sol [Line: 55](src/WETH9.sol#L55)

	```solidity
	            require(allowance[src][msg.sender] >= wad);
	```



## L-7: PUSH0 is not supported by all chains

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.

- Found in src/WETH9.sol [Line: 2](src/WETH9.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.13;
	```
